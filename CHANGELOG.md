## [0.4.0] - 2022-07-05
### Added

### Changed
- `useInstance` no longer returns the root instance. Instead, it returns a `ref` table, which is also created and passed to the `useInstance` function itself as a first parameter. You can create keys in the table to access instances in the widget body.
- The `create` function now has special behavior if a key is passed in the props table. It will set a value in the table to the instance that's being created at the key specified by the value in the props table. E.g., `[ref] = "button"` will set the key "button" in the `ref` table to the button that was created.
- `automaticSize` now covers more cases, including text objects and objects with no UIGridStyleLayout within them.
- The window widget is now draggable, resizable, and closable.

- label, checkbox, heading, table, window now support RichText
- Buttons are appropriately sized to their text contents
